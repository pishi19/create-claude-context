â”œâ”€â”€ examples/           # Example configurations
â””â”€â”€ test/               # Test files
```

## Coding Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Example
```javascript
const config = {
  name: 'example',
  type: 'node',
  features: [
    'dashboard',
    'todos',
  ],
};
```

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

Write tests for any new functionality:

```javascript
describe('featureName', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    expect(myFunction()).toBe(expectedResult);
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update API.md if you change the API
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions
- Include examples in documentation

## Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add Python project type support
fix: correct path resolution on Windows
docs: update API examples for TypeScript
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "chore: release v1.2.3"`
4. Tag release: `git tag v1.2.3`
5. Push: `git push origin main --tags`
6. GitHub Actions will automatically publish to npm

## Adding New Project Types

To add support for a new project type:

1. Add detection logic in `lib/utils/project.js`
2. Create configuration in `getProjectConfig()`
3. Add example in `examples/[type]-example.md`
4. Update documentation
5. Add tests

Example:
```javascript
// In detectProjectType()
if (fs.existsSync(path.join(projectPath, 'Gemfile'))) {
  return 'ruby';
}

// In getProjectConfig()
ruby: {
  buildCommand: 'bundle install',
  testCommand: 'rspec',
  excludePatterns: ['vendor/**', '.bundle/**'],
  todoPatterns: ['*.rb', '*.rake']
}
```

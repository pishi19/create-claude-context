# Claude Context - Value Proposition

## 🎯 The One-Liner

**Claude Context eliminates the #1 friction in AI-assisted development: context management.**

## 🚀 The Problem We Solve

Every AI conversation starts with 5-10 minutes of context explanation. Multiply that by 10 conversations daily, across your entire team, for a year. That's **200+ hours per developer** wasted annually on repetitive context sharing.

## 💡 Our Solution

Claude Context automatically maintains, updates, and provides complete project context to any AI assistant, transforming sporadic AI help into a continuous, context-aware development partner.
